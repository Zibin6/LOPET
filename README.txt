
This repository provides a simplified MATLAB code for our event-based object pose tracking method.

Firstly, extract the "event.zip" file to the current directory, and then execute the "main_demo.m".

Due to file size limitations, only a portion of the testing events are uploaded for demonstration purposes.

Details of the method can be found in our paper:
