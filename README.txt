
This repository provides a simplified MATLAB code of Our event-based object pose tracking method.

Firstly, extract the "event.zip" file to the current directory, and then execute the "main_demo.m".

Due to file size limitations, only a portion of the testing events are uploaded for demonstration purposes.

Details of the method can be found in our paper:
Line-based 6-DoF Object Pose Estimation and Tracking With an Event Camera
Zibin Liu, Banglei Guan, Yang Shang, Qifeng Yu, and Laurent Kneip.
The paper is currently under review and will be made public soon.
